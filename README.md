<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]][demo-url]

[Inviso](https://invisoapp.com.tr/) is a data collection app so what that means is 
like google forms you can build custom forms and assign users to it and let the 
users collect data for you. This project built using Spring Boot, Spring Security 
with JWT Authentication, Spring Data JPA and Hibernate with PostgreSQL. The 
frontend side was not the aim of this project, so i've not built a frontend but i 
download all of the static content with [Httrack](https://www.httrack.com/) from 
the original site and modify it a little bit (just for the demonstration purpose 
for the backend i've build) and integrate it with the backend.

**You can access demo [Here][demo-url] with username and password: `sau:sau`.**
